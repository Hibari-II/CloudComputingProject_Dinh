Project Description:
A Cloud based web application. Webservers are configured with Terraform and for Monitoring the server Grafana and Promtheus were utilized. If the webserver has reached a specific load, Grafana will send an webhook to the autoscaler, who communicates with the cloud provider and adds/reduces the web server.
